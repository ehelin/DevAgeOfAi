# 📜 DevAgeOfAi

**An experimental playground exploring the intersection of AI, automation, and software craftsmanship.**

## 🧠 What is DevAgeOfAi?

DevAgeOfAi is a hands-on lab for exploring how modern AI tools can reshape the development process itself — from writing code to refactoring, testing, and even creating new projects from scratch. This isn't just about automation; it’s about collaboration between human intent and machine augmentation.

This project includes:
- 🛠️ Prompt engineering and response tuning (with OpenAI, Phi, Mistral, and more)
- 🔁 Local model testing and prompt orchestration
- 🧪 Evaluation of developer workflows with AI as a co-creator
- 🧠 Experiments with prompt-driven Python scripts and .NET integrations

---

## 🚀 Goals

- **Reimagine** the developer workflow in the age of generative AI  
- **Test-drive** real-world usage patterns of AI in full-stack development  
- **Build** tooling that augments, not replaces, developer creativity  
- **Fail** in interesting ways — and document the journey

---

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- C#, .NET 8, Razor Pages  
- Python (AI model scripting & automation)  
- Node.js / TypeScript (for service wiring and logic tests)  
- Local LLM testing (Ollama, HuggingFace models)  
- Azure SQL, CLI scripting, GitHub Copilot, and more

---

## 🗂️ Key Project Areas

- `/Ai/` – Core directory for AI experiments and logic  
  - `/AiModelRunner/` – Executes and refines responses from LLMs  
  - `/AiModelApi/` – Local API interface for model interactions  
  - `/Ai_Training/` – Setup and scripting for local model experimentation

- `/HabitTrackerApps/` – Tangible use case integrating AI for productivity

- `/BLL/` and `/Shared/` – Standard business logic and shared utilities  
- `/RunCommands/` – Batch scripts and execution helpers for orchestrating local AI workflows

## 📍 Inspiration

Born out of curiosity, this project is my answer to a simple question:  
**What happens when a full-stack developer hands the keyboard to AI — and doesn’t let go?**
